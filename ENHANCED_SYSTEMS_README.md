## üîß Game Engine Integration

### Updated Components

The main `GameEngine` class has been enhanced with:

- **PopulationManager** integration for development projects
- **MonumentManager** for world monuments
- **EventManager** for flavor events
- **Ruler** and **Advisor** systems

### New Manager Access

```java
// Access new managers through GameEngine
PopulationManager populationManager = engine.getPopulationManager();
MonumentManager monumentManager = engine.getMonumentManager();
EventManager eventManager = engine.getEventManager();
```

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Starting a Development Project

```java
Province province = country.getProvinces().get(0);
boolean success = populationManager.startDevelopmentProject(
    province, 
    PopulationManager.DevelopmentType.INFRASTRUCTURE, 
    1000 // workers
);
```

### Building a Monument

```java
WorldMonument colosseum = WorldMonument.createColosseum();
boolean success = monumentManager.startMonumentConstruction("Colosseum", country);
```

### Processing Events

```java
// Events are automatically processed by the EventManager
// Choices can be made through the UI
eventManager.executeEventChoice("plague_outbreak", country, 0);
```

### Managing Rulers and Advisors

```java
Ruler ruler = new Ruler("Trajan", 45);
ruler.update(); // Generates monarch points

Advisor advisor = Advisor.createAdministrativeAdvisor("Marcus Agrippa", 3);
advisor.hire();
Map<String, Double> bonuses = advisor.getBonuses();
```

## üß™ Testing
